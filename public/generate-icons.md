# Generate PWA Icons

You need to create the following icons in the `public` folder:

1. **pwa-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **pwa-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels  
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixels
4. **favicon.ico** - 32x32 pixels

## Quick Option: Use an Icon Generator

Visit one of these sites with your logo/icon:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Upload a 512x512 PNG of your restaurant logo and it will generate all sizes.

## Manual Option: Using any image editor

1. Create a square image (512x512) with your restaurant logo
2. Resize to create the different sizes needed
3. Save them in the `public` folder with the names above

## Temporary Placeholder

For now, you can use a colored square as placeholder:
- Background color: Orange (#FF6B35)
- Add text "R" for Restaurant in white

The PWA will work without icons, but users won't see a nice icon when they install it.
